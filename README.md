## Annotation

OpenStreetMap is the best platform for open map data. Its is used as a datasource for companies like Mapbox, Foursquare, Strava or Mapy.cz. Let's play with various APIs both Google- and OSM-based, compare JS frameworks and try services like geocoding, routing, elevations, raster/vector tiles and more. Also, we will touch the topic of OpenStreetMap.
